          <small>HOW IS THE COMPETITION ORGANIZED</small>
          <p>The competition holds in two stages,</p>
          <p>The first stage is an MCQ(MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS) which is taken online,
            from home. The first stage tests for the competitor's <span>Aptitude, Accuracy and Critical Thinking.</span>
            It holds for 2hrs, and covers 40% of the competition.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second stage is Structural and lasts for 3 days. This covers 60% of the competition.
            How solutions will be submitted will be communicated to those who are registered.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before these two stages, a Qualification Challenge will be administered to the registered
            students, on the first week of November, to select those who will be eligible for the 
            First and Second stages, which will hold on the 27th to the 30th of December, 2023.
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Qualification session is a series of 20 Basic MCQ questions 
            which applicants will answer within 40 mins. Your score in the Qualification round
          doesn't count, but having a 12/20 makes you a good fit for the competition Stage.</span>
          This Qualification round is meant to give applicants an overview and insights of what the maths@njahmi End of Year 
          competition (MEOYC) looks like, and to inform them how ready they are.
